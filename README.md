Until the project is approved on CurseForge, you'll have to manually import the profile by getting it from the Releases page on this repo.

1. Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Therkelsen/echoes_of_the_wilderness/releases) and download the latest realease .zip file.

2. If you don't already have it, download and install the [CurseForge launcher](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).

3. Importing the modpack profile<br>
a. Open CurseForge<br>
b. Click the home button<br>
c. Click on Minecraft<br>
d. Click "Create Custom Profile"<br>
e. Click "Or import a previously created profile"<br>
f. Select the .zip file you previously downloaded

Once it's done importing the profile, it should be ready to launch and play!

# Config
Many of the mods are configurable either through the in-game Mods tab, or by heading over to the config folder of the pack through Curse Forge. 

This is done by:<br>
1. Click on the mod pack
2. Click the settings button
3. Click "Open Folder"
4. Finally, head into the "config" folder

Now that you're in the config folder, simply open and edit whichever config file you want to!
